I'm planning to write a series of posts that talk about time and clocks in distributed systems.

Instead of doing a series of posts I could conceivably write a (very) long post instead, but I think doing it this way increases the odds that I will actually write it.

Once an entry is written I will link to it from this page.
Note that I will write entries a bit fast and loose, so it is likely that I will come back later and update entries.

After reading the series of posts you should hopefully understand how [ICSync](https://github.com/niklasekstrom/icsync/) works, and how it can be used to implement a linearizable partitioned distributed data storage system.

List of entries:
